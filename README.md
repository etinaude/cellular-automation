## excel cellular automation 

I created this a few years ago and found it sitting around on my google drive and thought somone might find it intersting
[cellular automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) is a system of creating patterns based on a byte binary input as a rule and a sinle bit to be processed
that bits output creates part of the input for the next series.

a well knowen example of cellular automation is [conways game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

I will hopefully work on updating this in the future

currently the first line is the input to be processed and the bottom shows the rule which the input is proccessed by (hard coded at the moment, this will hopefully change)

there is a key on the left if the cells above (top left, top, top right) the current cell are what is shown in the key then the cell will change to the shown output, no cell it counted as a light grey/white cell (0). this patern flows down to the 50th row.

**there are no macros in this it based purely on conditional formatting and cell referencing**
