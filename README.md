## excel cellular automation 

I created this a few years ago and found it sitting around on my google drive and thought somone might find it intersting, So I thought Id update it

[cellular automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) is a system of creating patterns based on cell values around next to a perticular cell

a well knowen example of cellular automation is [conways game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

I will hopefully keep working on updating this in the future

this is an example of [elementary cellular automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), the first row betwen the purple cells is the user input row, the rows beneath that change their colour based on the "rule" and the user input.

there is a key on under the size input. For each cell look at the 3 cells above it then follow the key then that cell will change to that value

**this version has been updated to use macros rather than cell formulae**
