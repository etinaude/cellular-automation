## excel cellular automation 
 
I created this a few years ago and found it sitting around on my google drive and thought someone might find it interesting, So I thought I'd update it
 
[cellular automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) is a system of creating patterns based on cell values around next to a particular cell
 
a well known example of cellular automation is [conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
 
I will hopefully keep working on updating this in the future
 
this is an example of [elementary cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), the first row between the purple cells is the user input row, the rows beneath that change their colour based on the "rule" and the user input.
 
there is a key on under the size input. For each cell look at the 3 cells above it then follow the key then that cell will change to that value
 
**this version has both a macros edition and a cell formulae edition**
 
the macro edition uses 1s and 0s BUT the formulae edition uses "B"s and "W"s since excel unpredictably switched 0 to "0" and vise versa same for the ones.
